# hello-world
trying to learn new things

My initial reason for being on here is to find some python code for a raspberry pi photobooth.
My only coding experience is making BASIC programs on my TI-83 calculator back in high school,
and tweaking and piecing together existing code in macros in MS Excel (VBA).  

Ultimately I want to start developing my own Python stuff, and eventually get into Android stuff.

Baby steps.
